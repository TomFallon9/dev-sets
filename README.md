## Purpose

The pandemic required many workers to shift from having their own workspace at an office to their home. In that time, many people upgraded and reinvented their setups. DevSets allows users to showcase their workspaces, post pictures and details of your workspace! Not using your set up for work? Showcase your PC gaming builds, specs and/or useful tips that helped you perfect your perfect setup. 

Want to showcase a little more than just what you work on? Showcase a personal Github repository and peek the interest of others with your projects. Share, collaborate and explore it all on DevSets.
